# titanic_analysis.ipynb

Comprehensive analysis of Titanic passengers using Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn). The project focuses on identifying the key factors that influenced passenger survival. 
age, ticket class, cabin, family size) had the strongest impact on survival outcomes

**Completed tasks:**

>1. Data Loading & Initial Inspection

- Imported the dataset and validated the structure and correctness of the loaded data.


>2. Data Cleaning

- Removed duplicate entries

- Converted column data types where necessary

- Filled in missing values using appropriate methods


>3. Feature Engineering

- Created new columns to improve the analysis, including boolean indicators

- Generated additional categorical and numerical features to support deeper insights

- Applied lambda functions for efficient data transformation


>4. Exploratory Data Analysis

- Analyzed survival rates across multiple passenger categories

- Identified correlations and high-impact factors

- Visualized key metrics using countplots and pie charts

- Applied data aggregation functions (groupby, agg) to compute survival ratios and comparisons


>5. Conclusions

- Summarized insights about which factors (age, ticket class, cabin, family size) had the strongest impact on survival outcomes
